Writing back on this on the way back to London from day 1 of Render Conf 2017 in Oxford leaves me wishing I could attend Day 2, however, cycling commitments the next few days got in the way. I don't normally do a write up about some of the events I attend - mainly because of lack of time, but also a lot I leave them thinking "that was good, but....". Render, while quite small in size (only about 400 attendes) really packed a punch for all experience levels.

 The morning started off with a more theory and opinionated approach with talks from Jeremy Keith and Sarah Davies on "Evaluating Technology" and "Accessibility and Screen Readers" respectably. Just before the lunch break came the talk I most anticipated from Ben Ilegbodu at Eventbrite displaying how they have managed to incorporate Isomorphic JavaScript (Node + React) with their Drupal server. This is something that I've always had an interest in having worked with PHP in WordPress and wishing to pair that with the power of JavaScript.

 Ben kicked off that transition to the more **practical** talks which included (the some what famous) Umar Hansa of DevTips, "Progressive Image Rendering" by Jose Perez of Spotify and the brilliantly curated Star Wars "Packwars" talk by Opher Vishnia.

 Part 2 and 3 to follow with a dive into some of the opinions, practices and packages/frameworks that were shown by the talks
