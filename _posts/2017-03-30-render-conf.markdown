Writing this on the way back to London from day 1 of [Render Conf 2017](http://2017.render-conf.com//) in Oxford leaves me wishing I could attend Day 2, however, cycling commitments the next few days have got in the way. I don't normally do a write up about some of the events I attend straight away - mainly because of lack of time, but also a lot I leave them thinking "that was good, but....". Render, while quite small in size (only about 400 attendees), really packed a punch for all experience levels.

 The morning started off with a more theory and opinionated approach with talks from [Jeremy Keith](https://twitter.com/adactio) and [Seren Davies](https://twitter.com/ninjanails) on "Evaluating Technology" and "Accessibility and Screen Readers" respectably. Just before the lunch break came the talk I most anticipated from [Ben Ilegbodu](https://twitter.com/benmvp) at Eventbrite displaying how they have managed to incorporate Isomorphic JavaScript (Node + React) with their Drupal server. This is something that I've always had an interest in having battled with WordPress devs about how "there is just no space for React in our projects".

 Ben kicked off the transition to the more _practical_ talks which included (the somewhat famous) [Umar Hansa](https://twitter.com/umaar) of DevTips, "Progressive Image Rendering" by [Jose Perez](https://twitter.com/jmperezperez) of Spotify and the brilliantly curated Star Wars "Packwars" talk by [Opher Vishnia](https://twitter.com/opherv).

 Part 2 and 3 to follow with a dive into some of the opinions, practices and packages/frameworks that were discussed in the talks.
