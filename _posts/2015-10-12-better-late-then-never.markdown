Its been a year since I released my first - and lets be honest - very basic personal site, and since then I have been employed by Big Fish for a whole year. It doesnâ€™t seem a year ago in terms of time, but looking back on it, between leaving GA and now I could not have imagined the things that I have picked up. I have developed two sites from scratch, learnt new frameworks and languages - writing code in all of them!

Anyway, I am going to try my hand at a blog on the things that I am working on and things that I think are pretty cool around the web. Stay tuned!
