Illness and a heavy crash racing has delayed the writing of this - hopefully my 
memory won't fail me about some of the speakers a week ago.

## Evaluating Technology
[Jeremy Keith]() opened up the conference by discussing the nature of technology 
and what, as humans, our relationship is to it. Opening the discussion with the 
nature of technology, he discusses how technology is inherently a domain of 
co-opperation. Working closely with other devs and the open source nature of modern 
web development is clear, and if you have experienced this first hand I would be 
very surprised as our industry is one of the most inclusive. This is shown first
 hand by Apple and Samsung, two market leading brands who share the similar 
 hardware in their manufacturing. 
 
 Although hardware is the basis for which software can run, the availability of 
 hardware is now almost in surplus and it is software that is now become more 
 important. At the dawn of the home computer back in the 70s it was a scramble to 
 get the latest device, now with the same power coming from a mobile phone, it is 
 how software is the availability of software and its performance which is in the 
 spotlight.
 
 The talked moved away from this shift in paradigms to to the usability of current
  software and its design principles. I think the most relatable and easy to grasp 
  example of this are service workers. Jeremy argues that while we should be 
  aiming to provide the best experience for all, we should also be able to provide
   the best experience for when technology fails. Service workers for example, 
   should be able to enhance a users interaction (as they do), but if they "fail" 
   they should not effect the user (as they do, well, sorta) - if a 
   browser doesn't support service workers, then nothing changes to that of a first visit 
   with a compatible browser.
   
   Another interesting point is that while code is not intrinsically opinionated, 
   it is still bias. Opinions usually arise from different sides of an argument, 
   but developers all have their way of doing things - hence the emergence of 
   linting. There are different libraries, languages, code styles etc that all 
   lend themselves towards providing a "better" solution.
