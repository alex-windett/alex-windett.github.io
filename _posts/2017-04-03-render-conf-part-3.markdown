A quick final post to give credit to all the speakers that made the day very 
interesting.

- [Umar Hansa](https://github.com/umaar) (the guy who creates [those awesome gif 
emails](https://umaar.com/dev-tips/)). As always provided a
 huge amount of insight into Chrome Canary's hidden flags and how to use them. One
  of the coolest and one that I will hopefully adopt in the future is the fully 
  integrated console in the Chrome window. Having had a play around with it there
   are still some teething problems, but along with in browser editing, there 
   could well be very little need to leave your Chrome window.
   
   Along side this, Chrome's developer console is now allowing for multi cursor 
   support (like sublime and many other IDE's), clever function parentheses and 
   lines, and inline debuggers (instead of per line debuggers). 
- [Opher Vishnia](https://github.com/OpherV) talked about packwars, while very interesting, my current work has
 some what forced me down the route of Webpack.
 - [Jose Perez](https://github.com/JMPerez) went on the show us how Spotify was using progressive image 
 rendering across its applications, highlighting different techniques from lazy 
 load to color background loading (like on Google Images) to `srcset`.
 - [Jessica Lord](https://github.com/jlord) presented her product that allowed for a CMS system to be managed 
 via the Google Sheets API, making it accessible for all to use with [sheetsee.js](https://github.com/jlord/sheetsee.js)
