I have recently completed the General Assembly Web Development Immersive course and as result have become driven to build a career in digital development, using my newly gained skills. 

I am ambitious, hard working and enjoy solving problems with creative ideas. I am self-motivated and can work independently but am also effective working within the dynamics of a collaborative environment. My ideal role would be as a junior full stack developer within a team where I can apply my experience from GA to create web and mobile applications.
