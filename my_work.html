<p>Starting off as a full stack developer in 2014 after learning web development at General Assembly, I now focus in my front end skills.</p>

<p>Currently working as a front end developer at Big Fish Design in London, I maintain and develop large scale sites. I was given the role of lead dev on the creationg and release of <a href="http://www.9bar.com">9Bar</a>. I now look after the refactoring and imporvements of this site, alongside the redevelopment of all the <a href="http://www.tyrrellscrisps">Tyrrells'</a> sites and the upkeep of many more</p>
