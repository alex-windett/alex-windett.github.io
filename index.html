	<h3>About Me</h3>
	<p class="center">Having completed General Assemblyâ€™s Immersive course in 2014, I have gone on to work at Big Fish Design building and maintain CMS systems in a small team of 5. Alongside my work at Big Fish I explore other frameworks and ways to improve my skills. I have found an particular interest in Polymer and am always looking into ways to improve my Sass and workflow, and to conitnually follow the latest frameworks and trends.</p>
