	<h3>About Me</h3>
	<p class="center">Having completed General Assembly&rsquo;s Immersive Course in 2014, I now work for Big Fish Design Ltd. &ndash; a design, branding and marketing consultancy where I build and maintain CMS systems for a wide range of clients. While utilising my existing experience this job has also given me the opportunity to explore other frameworks and ways to further my skills. At the moment, I am particularly interested in Web Components and Google Polymer and I am always looking for ways to improve upon my Front End skills and workflow.</p>
