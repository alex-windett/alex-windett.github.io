	<h3>About Me</h3>

	<p class="center">Starting off as a Full Stack developer in 2014 after learning web development at General Assembly, I now focus my skills as a Front End Devloper and also contribute in with the UX design process.</p>

	<p class="center">Currently working as a UX Designer and Front End Developer at Make Us Proud in London, I am designing and creating an initial prototype for a competitor to AWS. Previously, I was given the role of lead dev on a number of WordPress builds including <a href="http://www.9bar.com">9Bar</a> and <a href="http://www.tyrrellscrisps.co.uk">Tyrrells'</a>, later on leading a small agile team to create a Single Page Web app with React / Redux for <a href="http://www.freddiesflowes.com">Freddie's Flowers</a>.</p>

	<p class="center">I am always interested in developing my skills further, and use my knowledge as a Front End Developer to improve the Ux process. Outside of work I try and fit attending meetups and conferences around a semi-hectic cycling schedule - competing in road races, a few track events and the odd triathlon end of the season to name&nbsp;a&nbsp;few.</p>

	<h3>Portfolio</h3>
	<p class="center">Initially starting out as a Full Stack Ruby Developer, I now focus on building and designing clean, modular Front End web apps. These are just a few of the projects that I have worked on&nbsp;recently:</p>

	<ul class="block--grid">

			<article>
				<h4>{{ project.name }}</h4>
