	<h3>About Me</h3>

	<p class="center">Starting off as a Full Stack developer in 2014 after learning
		web development at General Assembly, I now focus my skills as a Frontend
		Developer and UX Designer.</p>

	<p class="center">Currently working at <a href="http://www.makeusproud.com/" target="_blank">Make Us Proud in London</a>, I am
		building and designing the Beta version of Joyent's upgrade to its cloud
		container service. Prior to this, I was given the role of lead dev on a number of
		WordPress builds including <a target="_blank" href="http://www.9bar.com">9Bar</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tyrrellscrisps.co.uk">Tyrrells'</a>,
		later on leading a small agile team to create a Single Page Web app with React / Redux for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.freddiesflowes.com">Freddie's&nbsp;Flowers</a>.</p>

	<p class="center">I am always interested in developing my skills further, and use my knowledge as a Frontend Developer to improve the UX process. Outside of work I try and fit attending meetups and conferences around a semi-hectic cycling schedule - competing in road races, a few track events and the odd end of season triathlon to name&nbsp;a&nbsp;few.</p>

	<h3>Portfolio</h3>
	<p class="center">Initially starting out as a Full Stack Ruby Developer, I now focus on building and designing clean, modular Frontend web apps. These are just a few of the projects that I have worked on&nbsp;recently:</p>
