            <p>A year ago I completed the General Assembly Web Development Immersive course and as result have become driven to build a career in digital development. Currently working at Big Fish Design as a Front End Developer in their Web Depeartment, I have created and maintained large scale sites for their clients. I am always interested in working outside of the office looking for projects to advance and put to use my expertise.</p>

            <p>I am ambitious, hard working and enjoy solving problems with creative ideas. I am self-motivated and can work independently but am also effective working within the dynamics of a collaborative environment. I am ever on the look out for new projects to work on whether thats starting from scratch or imporving on excisting site..</p>
